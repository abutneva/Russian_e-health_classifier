**Object:** Russian e-health system
**Target groups:** patients (P), doctors (D), health insurance (I)
	
**Characteristics:** Windows 10, Python 3.8 (64-bite version), supported by C++ Build Tools in Visual Studio and command prompt 

**Objectives:**

1.	Advancing NLP libraries for a better recognition of high-level Russian texts, e.g., scholarly literature, medical acts.

2.	Defining key abbreviations in the telemedicine area

3.	Defining core e-health actors

4.	Visualizing processed texts, semantic trends for obtaining specific P, D, I information about the content

**Work prospects.** Authors suggest four optimization stages for smoothing relationships among P, D, and I. This code technically supports and  automatizes the first stage in four directions: telemedicine, teleconsulting, telediagnostics, and e-health web portals.

**Application.** Program aims at optimizing linkages among three participants of Russian e-health business model (D, P, I); suitable for use as: (a) a universal e-health classifier; (b) a supporting program for better reading and understanding e-medical acts by patients; (c) an assistant in analyzing client base of health insurance companies; (d) an auxiliary tool for descriptive analysis of scholarly articles for Russian scientists working in e-health area. The average processing rate for an exemplary 10-15-page text is approximately 2 min. However, speed varies depending on the processor’s capabilities and texts’ length.

**Novelty:** (1) applying natural language processing (NLP) principles for Russian, specifically, for scientific (medical) vocabulary, which significantly improves communication between D and I; (2) a direct and interactive visualization of NLP analysis results; (3) detection and definition of sophisticated medical abbreviations in HTML format, which improves communication between P and D; (4) text lemmatization, allowing for calculating precise descriptive statistics based on relevant lexemes for I; (5) possibilities for manually extending medical dictionaries, for instance, when innovations are introduced, improving communication within and among medical communities.
